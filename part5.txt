---------------------------
1) Inheritance
---------------------------
(1) How it's incorporated:
   - We have a base class 'Post' containing common attributes (title, url, timestamp, etc.) 
     and two derived classes: 'Reel' and 'Story'. Each subclass inherits fields and methods 
     from 'Post' while adding or overriding specialized features—Reels have a 90-second 
     limit and add AR effects, while Stories have a 60-second limit and expiration time.

(2) Why it's important:
   - Inheritance avoids repetitive code for shared post functionality, improving 
     maintainability. It also makes our code more flexible, because introducing new 
     post types only requires creating another subclass.

---------------------------
2) Polymorphism
---------------------------
(1) How it's incorporated:
   - 'Post' declares a pure virtual function edit(), which 'Reel' and 'Story' override 
     differently. We store pointers to 'Post' in our LinkedBag, allowing each derived 
     object to respond to edit() in its own way.

(2) Why it's important:
   - Polymorphism enables calling edit() on any type of Post without needing to know 
     whether it's a Reel or a Story. This simplifies code in the client (like the User 
     class) and allows easy expansion of the codebase if new post types are introduced.
